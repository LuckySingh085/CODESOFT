                <h3 style="color: rgb(0, 255, 47);">What is the E-learning ?</h3> <i> eLearning (e-learning, electronic learning)
                     is a type of online education, training, 
                    and knowledge sharing that is conducted over the Internet. It can be utilized in various settings, such as academic education, corporate training, 
                    continuing professional development, and skill development courses.

                    The growth of eLearning has been facilitated by the widespread adoption of computers and internet technology, and was 
                    further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a surge in demand for online learning solutions</i>
                <br>
                <h3 style="color: rgb(0, 255, 94);">The History of eLearning</h3><i>The term eLearning was coined by US learning guru Elliott Masie in November 1999, when he delivered his speech at the TechLearn Conference: “eLearning is the use of network technology to design, deliver, select, administer, and extend learning.”

                In 2000, eLearning was revolutionized as a technology with the release of OLAT, the first open-source learning management system. That year also saw the release of the first version of SCORM, a standard that enables users to package content and distribute it within an LMS.
                
                In the early 2000s, mobile devices became more and more prevalent, and took the form of smartphones and tablets. They were no longer used just to make calls: people watched videos (in terms of learning, this involved pre-recorded lecture content), read books, and played games on their phones. That prompted cellular companies to improve mobile connectivity, a race that continues to this day.
                
                Mobile devices are now a popular choice to access eLearning, both for businesses and general education.</i></P>

                <h6>A landing page is one of the best web development projects for beginners. This project demands a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS. You will learn how to add columns, divide sections, arrange items, add headers, footers. Most
                    importantly, you will use your creativity to make the page look impressive. The alignments, the padding, the color palette, boxes and all the other elements on the page require attention. Use CSS carefully to make sure the elements
                    on the page do not overlap.
